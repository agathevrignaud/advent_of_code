## about
My [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021) submissions/solutions in JavaScript (2021, 2015), and Python (2020, to come)

Progress is tracked in a private leaderboard; the goal isn't to score or win, but rather to finish all challenges and learn new ways to use functions & solve problems ðŸŒ» (and I'm having a blast so far)

Solutions have thus been reworked to look more presentable (thankfully)
