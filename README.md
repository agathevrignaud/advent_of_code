## about
My [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) submissions/solutions in JavaScript (2015, [2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021), [2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022))

Progress is tracked in a private leaderboard; the goal isn't to score or win, but rather to finish all challenges and learn new ways to use functions & solve problems ðŸŒ» (and I'm having a blast so far)

Solutions have thus been reworked to look more presentable (thankfully)
